# Hangman Game

Within Hangman, the player's objective is to identify a hidden word with a given amount of letters. The words are randomly chosen from a specific dataset. The player guesses one letter of the alphabet each round until either the word is completely revealed or a man's body is drawn on a gibbet. If the man is fully drawn, the player loses. A visible record of all guessed letters is shown every round.
